Moreover, once a person obtains a PhD, there is no guarantee that even with an offer from a business school, that the PhD student will go on to publish his or her research in a top journal, will be able to teach effectively, or will receive a tenured faculty position.

Still, for those who have the motivation, drive and stamina to be successful in this field, there are many benefits. The life of a business professor is markedly different from a corporate career. An academic has more time to explore his or her own interests, pursues research, and rarely has a 'nine to five' type of career. Being a professor is much like being an entrepreneur , Success is based on the individual, and faculty are often their own bosses. Beyond being intellectually bright and able to conduct research, professors in business also need to be able to perform in the classroom. Teaching is a fundamental component of being a professor, though most faculty may only teach around 100 hours per year, the classroom setting can be challenging and often involve debate.

Not everyone can be a professor, but for those that have the skills required, it provides an excellent standard of living, with salaries comparable to the corporate Consulting, book publishing and speaking engagements can also further add to overall compensation. Academic institutions are often less vulnerable than corporations to forces like global economic downturns. Academia offers much in the way of financial stability.","RAPANDEEP"

A lack of business professors means that career opportunities in this area are better than ever. Whether you decide to enter academia or private industry, a small business PhD is a formidable qualification that can open many doors. Yet, there are prices to earning a PhD that must be completely considered. Below you can find more about the pros and cons of finishing a small business PhD.

Pros to obtaining your PhD

1. Business Professors are in High Demand
There are a number of reasons for this scenario. Primarily, the number of pupils enrolling in business courses has considerably grown. Unlike other academic subjects just a relatively modest fraction of these pupils will pursue academic roles themselves as the private sector will be joined by many. Secondly lots of the present business faculty are retiring. These factors have lead to a strong demand for folks holding company PhDs.

2. Shortage Of Business Professors Leads To High Typical Salaries
With close to a six number starting wages due to the demand for business professors and with a relative lack of capable faculty, there's a high average wages for the profession, in reality, many company professors start. This salary can be further supplemented by consulting, writing textbooks, and summer teaching places. As a consequence becoming a business professor might be an extremely profitable profession.

3. Rewarding Career With Great Lifestyle
Becoming a small business professor supplies with you the possibility to relish a rewarding career using a lifestyle that few other jobs can match. As a business professor you can help shape the minds of a future generation of business leaders. The job enables professors to share those thoughts with a wider audience and to pursue the ideas that interest them.

4. Chances Outside Of Academia
One of the best things about possessing a small business PhD is that the opportunities are not restricted to a life in academia. Getting a business PhD illustrates a high degree of academic skill and knowledge. A business PhD may cause quite profitable work in investment banking, consulting and other sectors of private industry. Those with business PhDs additionally regularly go onto working for the government and organisations such as the World Trade Organization and also the International Monetary Fund.

5. Costs Of Getting A Business PhD
The complete prices should be evaluated before embarking on a PhD program. Yet pupils who are totally self-financing will have to settle the entire class fees. The cost of these fees will depend on which areas you are contemplating studying and where you're living. It will vary according to whether you're full or a part time pupil. Fulltime pupils for EU or UK students can expect to pay study. between GBP3,000 - GBP4,000 for full-time For non UK or EU students of studying for a business PhD the cost will generally be around GBP10,000 a year.

Would-Be company PhD students also need to take into account how much the opportunity costs in terms of time till they choose to analyze. A small business PhD will typically take around three years to complete if studying full time. Obviously, most PhD students will earn some type of income in this three year period, frequently working at the university. Then will cancel the loss of wages over this period. A PhD candidate gets GBP15,000 a year during their studies, then the true opportunity cost is just GBP45,000., if we contemplate that working part time Most company PhD students are readily able to recoup their lost gains within the space of a couple years of completing their PhD.

Is the investment worth it?
Obtaining a business PhD requires a substantial investment when it comes to time, money and energy as you are able to observe. However, the pay off for finishing the qualification may be equally substantial. Having a business PhD opens up a universe of rewarding and quite fulfilling career opportunities - and is an academic path well worth taking.","a1bc989d7fee35d06ce4e6ad3b599163ebd616c5eda632bc2deb5fcc0283f71"

In your essay, you need to argue whether it's a good idea for a government to tax junk food and high-calorie snacks. Find web pages supporting an argument in favor of a junk food tax.","33","Some college, no degree","{}","{}","Male","Less than $12,500","A controversial post printed in the June edition of Mayo Clinic Proceedings looks at how ""sin taxes"" - taxes on cigarettes, alcohol, sugary drinks and greasy foods - might be utilized to greatly enhance public health, as well as generate much-needed government revenue which (you'd hope) could be put back into health promotion.

After all, the risk factors for our most common chronic diseases are all related to drinking smoking, poor eating habits and lack of physical action.

Assuming the absurd subsidization of tobacco and sugar growing continues (for whatever concealed political reasons), sin taxes would change 3 of those 4 behavioral determinants of health.

And while I do not believe ""sin tax"" is the proper label here, it is certainly more memorable than ""Pigovian tax"" (after economist Arthur Pigou)- although I can give it a try.

Based on what the Mayo Clinic article writers, Dr. Michael Joyner and Dr. David Warner have discussed, here's 6 reasons a Pigovian tax on junk-food could work:

#1 We've been ""nannyed"" on tobacco and booze for decades - it works.

Taxes on tobacco and alcohol are (and have been) exceptionally successful in improving public health. There is a clear beneficial relationship between cost and tobacco consumption, and cost and alcohol consumption.

Imagine the public health developments that could be achieved with a junk food tax.

#2 Potential health benefits warrants a trial

Of course, whether a cost-increase on sugar and bad fats would influence consumption is debatable because we do not have signs yet. It simply hasn't been trialled properly at this phase.

But it's definitely not a brand new thought, and Mayor Bloomberg is still summoning to give it a trial with sugar-sweetened drinks. Furthermore, many say it will not work because junk foods are not addictive like cigarettes or alcohol, but I beg to differ.

The authors wrote, ""Given the significant role that consumption of these beverages plays in the obesity epidemic, the possible health benefits warrant additional exploration (of a junk-food tax).""

#3 We can learn from the mistakes of others

A tax on junk food isn't old. And France now has a successful tax on sugar-sweetened beverages. The UK, Switzerland and Germany are considering fat taxes.

And while the Danish fat-tax stopped this year, most of the reasons behind this conclusion would not always be reproduced here.

As an example, the primary difference between the Unites States and Denmark is so the inclusion of additional tax on fat proved to be a greater fiscal burden that the Danes already have one of the peak tax rates in the world. Additionally, Danes had been just crossing the border to Germany or Sweden to buy food (where prices are as much as 20 percent more economical).

We currently have a great case-study laid out before us in which we can assess what works and what does not.


#4 Sin taxes raise essential money - a LOT of it

Increase the tobacco tax by 50 cents per pack, and it'd raise $80 billion over the next ten years. Increase alcohol tax to 30% (it is now at 10%), and over the exact same time period $250 billion would be created. Not just pennies.

Joyner and Warner go on to estimate the effects of a 1 cent per ounce tax on sugary drinks would raise about $15-20 billion per year ($150 billion to $200 billion over 10 years).

And as a real-life example, we know that when Denmark's ""fat tax"" was in motion, it raised about $200 million in that one year. In the event the United States introduced a tax on high saturated fat food, it's estimated to generate $120 billion over a decade, given the population is about 60 times that of Denmark.

If we sum the approximations of these 4 sin taxes up, we are looking at about $600 billion or more of increased earnings over 10 years.

It is a substantial chunk of the increased sales politicians are discussing for the federal budget.

#5 Added earnings may be utilized to improve public health

The extra sales generated could likewise be utilized to further improve public health as I mentioned in the initial sentence.
Joyner and Warner suppose the escalation in resources could, ""Subsidize attention for the uninsured, buffer the fiscal pressures associated with Medicare and Medicaid, encourage increased physical activity and better nutrition in the population, construct public health infrastructure, or maybe increase federal funding for biomedical research.""

Of course we need to be realistic - sustained political pressure would be demanded for the tax dollars to actually be invested in well-being over the long term, rather than on other areas that are more significant. The military budget for example... ahem.

#6 Sin taxes aren't new to America

(I do not actually agree with the writers that this point is a valid reason, but I thought it fascinating however.)

From its modest beginnings, sin taxes have been used by the US as a major source of government revenue.

Had personal income tax not been created through the 16th Amendment in 1913, Prohibition wouldn't financially impossible.

Additionally, it is considered Prohibition was suddenly ended due to the demand for additional tax revenues in 1933.

Thus, you can view that sin taxes form a large phase in US history and should not be viewed as a strange concept that is new.","a1bc989d7fee35d06ce4e6ad3b599163ebd616c5eda632bc2deb5fcc0283f71"

However, some people still need the dependability of a great old-fashioned landline. And for most businesses, landlines are essential. You can nevertheless get a landline number from your local telephone or cable operator-- Verizon, AT&T, Comcast, Time Warner, as well as the remainder. However you can do better than that: You can make use of a lower-cost VoIP service which takes advantage of your broadband Internet connection to provide you with dependable phone service.

VoIP is normally very easy to set up: You get unique phone adapter unit or a carton from the service provider, plug it into power, your Internet router, plus a typical telephone handset. An option that's becoming less common would be to purchase a SIP phone, which includes electronic equipment enabling it to sidestep the need for the adapter.

The price differences between VoIP and normal landline services are truly significant: For example, in the New York region, a Verizon Freedom Value strategy that includes unlimited local and long-distance calling costs $59.99 per month. So you're taking a look at upwards of $50 only for landline service from the conventional Ma Bell duopoly. And you can get infinite U.S. and Canada calling with Skype, plus an inbound set phone number for only $7.95 per month.

Do VoIP services cost less than standard phone line services, however they also add features on top of what you get from the legacy suppliers. For example, PhonePower gets you an onscreen program that allows you to receive and make calls from your desktop computer. Vonage Android that act as extensions to your primary telephone and offers cellular programs for iOS. And both give you Web access to your voicemail and call history, and allow you to receive faxes to an email address. Skype is actually better known for its video phoning than its conventional telephone system capacities, and rich text messaging is also offered by that service. A great feature in all of these is ""telephone hunt"" which calls multiple telephones or apps until you pick up, or sends the call to voicemail. In addition, you get caller obstructing, three-way calling, and call.

Company VoIP
The business-focused entrants in this roundup, as you might anticipate, go considerably farther in added capacities, functioning as cloud-based PBXes (public branch exchanges). These let your organization present a professional look to the calling world, with features like call-routing, automated attendants, call record, and conference call bridges. They typically offer several pricing levels predicated on the number of lines needed, ranging from about $20 per line for big organizations to $35 per line for smaller groups; you also pay more for some extra features like integration with cloud company services for example Salesforce.com. For a superb summary of company VoIP, read the Phone Cord: Cutting on.

Emergency Calling: 911 and E911
Emergency service telephoning is an issue that VoIP providers used to really have a difficulty with, but for which they've now come up with a working alternative --with the important exception of Skype, which doesn't necessitate a separate telephone adapter box. You now have to define an address for 911 service when you sign up for Vonage or its ilk.

You could certainly get away with having a cellular as your only phone. But landline service retains its advantages, including never having to worry about how powerful your cell signal is or whether your battery has any charge made. Landlines and VoIP also have a tendency to provide sound that is dependable and clearer at all times.

RingCentral

Businesses, whether they're little shops or big corporations looking to replace their on-premises PBX hardware, can find anything they want in this full-service company VoIP provider. RingCentral will send you SIP business phones preconfigured to work with your company's account, making setup a no-brainer. Direction features like call transfer, screening, park, and logs come standard. The service also integrates with Microsoft Office, Outlook, Google, Carton, and Dropbox. Upgrades can add things like multilevel attendant functionality and automatic call record. In the event you are a company searching for a full-featured, easy-to-set-up VoIP system, RingCentral is worth serious thought.


Skype

Skype is well known to all as a way to make video calls over your PC, but nonetheless, it also lets you connect to regular landline telephones and mobiles as a VoIP service. Skype is a communication Swiss Army Knife-- pay or don't, and use all of it or merely a few of its own tools.


PhonePower

PhonePower strongly resembles Vonage among the VoIP providers included here. The organization sends you a box into which you plug your broadband Internet connection along with a conventional phone line. But PhonePower allows you to utilize a software phone to make calls from your PC and costs less than Vonage. While this service might not be quite as clever as Vonage, it provides characteristics that are desirable at a value that is very good.


Jive Hosted VoIP

Jive Communications offers most of the attributes seen in RingCentral, but it trails the latter of interface in ease of use and slickness. Call queues and call recordings, voicemail-to- mobile apps, email, and yet the capacity to eavesdrop on workers are among the many company characteristics of Jive. But setting up many multiple users is more of a chore than in RingCentral, and its particular management web site is more unresponsive.


Vonage

In case you have heard of only one VoIP service, it is Vonage. The business is going to send you an adapter box that's dirt easy to connect to broadband Internet and your telephone. The organization offers a Web interface that is polished, good call quality, and cellular programs that let your smartphone act as an extension of your line. Call Hunt and its SimulRing attributes ease multiple device use, and you also get other perks like discerning amount three-way calling, and call forwarding. However, the service is a bit on the expensive side, unless you pay for an extra line, and you also don't get a software mobile.","a1bc989d7fee35d06ce4e6ad3b599163ebd616c5eda632bc2deb5fcc0283f71"

She says she can feel her baby moving inside of her. A pelvic examination is performed by a physician and finds that not only is there no baby, there is no uterus. Her medical records show she had had a hysterectomy two years earlier.

This case presented itself to family practitioner, a professor and Paul Paulman at the University of Nebraska. It was his first encounter with a rare illness called false pregnancy, or pseudocyesis. ""I showed the woman a scan of her abdomen and clarified the facts,"" Paulman says, ""and then I never saw her again. I don't understand if she ever accepted the truth.""

In pseudocyesis, the mind deceives the body, and vice versa. Doctors think when a lady obsesses over pregnancy out of anxiety or desire, it develops. (Queen ""Bloody"" Mary I of England notoriously suffered false pregnancy under pressure to continue the royal line.) Menstruating may cease, or her tummy may become distended as a result of strain or constipation. But the hints are interpreted by her brain as pregnancy, which triggers the pituitary gland to secrete hormones like prolactin to ready the entire body to bear a kid. Her breasts swell, and she gains more weight round the midsection and might even lactate.

Pseudocyesis occurs in only 1 to 6 of every 22,000 pregnancies, and it can also happen to kids, elderly, and men. the ""I believe the guys are a bit more emotionally ill,"" Paulman says. Doctors face the individual with medical evidence and provide counselling. If that doesn't work, the patient could have an inherent psychotic illness.

A study of 81 expectant dads found that nearly half of them gained weight in the third trimester. Sympathy stomach pains during arrival are more common, Paulman says. ""I reckon we all desire to be in touch with our feminine side.""

The Benefits of a White Roof

A 1,000-square-foot cool roof conserves air conditioning use that otherwise would about half a ton of carbon dioxide per year. (The average total square footage of a home in the USA is more than 2,000.)

In areas that are urban, white roofs also help lower smog levels by lowering local temperatures, which have a tendency to be higher due to the large proportion of paved surfaces.

Critics have suggested white roofs do more damage than good in chillier climates. But research shows the warming advantages of a dark roof in the winter are insignificant because days are shorter, skies are more cloudy, the angle of sunlight is low, and at times roofs are covered in snow. ""The amount of heat savings you could lose in winter months would be, in the maximum, 30 percent of the summertime economies,"" Akbari says.

The optimum time to put in a cool roof is when a brand new roof is needed or important roof care is in order. Based on researchers, there's little difference between the price of roof colors.

Not prepared for a new roof but still desire to cool down? Install a roof coating that is white . There really are several coatings that will greatly improve the reflectance/emittance of a current roof. Plus, coatings seal and protect, potentially prolonging the life span of your roof.","a1bc989d7fee35d06ce4e6ad3b599163ebd616c5eda632bc2deb5fcc0283f71"

In this informative article I am going to clarify how hydroelectric power plants function.

Hydroelectric energy can be defined as a type of hydropower where the movement of running water (kinetic energy) is converted into electricity.

Solar energy drives directly the water cycle. A number of the water on the surface is vaporized, when the sun warm the water in the ocean. The water vapor rises and when it reaches higher layers of air and is cooled, the water falls down in the type of hail, rain or snow. The water flows in rivers and streams, finally reaching the sea where it again evaporates.

What exactly is Hydroelectricity? Hydroelectric energy is the consequence of heat energy from the sun and the gravitational forces from the earth, to answer the question.

How Hydroelectric Power Plants Operate

Head and the flow discovers the potential energy of a waterfall.

From the intake reservoir, the water flows down then, and to the power station into the turbine wheel.

Tidal Power

There are many methods to produce electricity other than the standard hydroelectric power plant. Tide power is a type of hydroelectricity that looks really promising. The basic gist of how tide power works is this:

Tidal power is the consequence of the moon and the sun's gravitational influence on the ocean. Height differences between low and high tides create tidal currents in coastal areas, and these currents can be strong enough to drive turbines.

Benefits and Drawbacks of Hydroelectricity

Advantages of Hydroelectric Energy

1. Sustainable

Hydroelectric energy is renewable. This means that we cannot up use. Nevertheless, there is just a restricted variety of appropriate reservoirs where hydroelectric power plants could be built and even less places where such jobs are profitable.

2. Green

Generating electricity with hydro energy isn't polluting itself. The single pollution happens during the construction of these huge power plants.

3. Reliable

Hydroelectricity is quite reliable energy. There are very little changes when it comes to the electric power that's being by the plants, unless a distinct output is desired. As long as there is water in the magazines electricity could be produced.

4. Adaptive

As previously mentioned, adjusting water flow and output of electricity is easy. At times where electricity consumption is low, water flow is reduced and also the magazine levels are being preserved for times when the power consumption is high.

5. Safe

Compared among others fossil fuels and nuclear energy, hydroelectricity is much safer to. There is no fuel involved (apart from water that is).

Disadvantages of Hydroelectric Energy

1. Environmental Effects

The environmental impacts of hydropower are related to the construction of roads and power lines as well as interventions in nature as a result of damming of water, changed water flow.

Hydroelectric power plants may influence fish is a complex interaction between numerous physical and biological variables. More user interests linked to exploitation of fish species, which helps that this is really a subject that many have strong opinions on.

Draining would be utterly devastating to the fish. Beyond this, the total amount of water may have distinct effects on the fish in a river, depending on the type and phase of the lifecycle. Not all unregulated river systems are best because of large fluctuations in flow, when it comes to fish production.

2. Expensive

Hydroelectric power plants are not an exception to this. On the other hand, these plants usually do not need lots of workers and maintenance costs are often not high.

3. Droughts

Energy prices and electricity generation are directly related to just how much water is accessible. A drought could potentially influence this.

4. Small Reservoirs

We have already began using suitable reservoirs for hydroelectric power plants up. There are currently about 30 major power plants which are anticipated to generate more than 2.000 MW under construction. Just one of these endeavors was began in the last couple of years.","a1bc989d7fee35d06ce4e6ad3b599163ebd616c5eda632bc2deb5fcc0283f71"

Find resources describings pros and cons of the practice of crossing purebred dogs.","33","Some college, no degree","{}","{}","Male","Less than $12,500","A crossbred (or crossbreed) dog is what you get when you breed one purebred dog to another purebred dog of a distinct strain.

Some individuals call them dogs that are hybrid, but that's erroneous. A hybrid is the offspring of two different species. For example, a horse bred to a donkey produces hybrid offspring (we call it a ""mule"").

But dog breeds are NOT different species. ""Breed"" is just the term we use for an inbred group of dogs within the same species, canis lupus familiaris. Crossing ""breeds"" doesn't produce hybrids.

Crossbreds are no more designed than purebreds, although some people call crossbred dogs designer dogs. For example, their breed was designed by Border Collie breeders by picking particular traits that will help their dogs be expert herders. Medium size, high energy, quickness, strong pursuing instincts, weatherproof jacket, etc. Border Collies are only as much designed as Goldendoodles.
Some unique combinations are given names.
Labradoodle (Labrador Retriever crossed with Poodle)
Cockapoo (Cocker Spaniel crossed with Poodle)
But whether a combination has been given a name or not does not matter. If a male Siberian Husky finds and escapes through his lawn, a female Dalmatian in heat, just down the block, the resulting puppies will still be crossbred even though no specific name has been coined for a Siberian-Dalmatian cross. (Siberdal, anyone? Sibermatian?)

One purebred dog bred to a purebred dog of a distinct strain = crossbred puppies. No cutesy names required.

Edges of crossbred dogs

Crossbred dogs often truly have a reasonable appearance.

The deformities which were inflicted on purebred dogs - tiny size, giant size, quite short nose, protruding eyes, short crooked legs, a long back, loose jowls, long heavy ears, wrinkled folds of skin, etc. - can only be preserved by blatantly and always breeding such dogs COLLECTIVELY.

When a purebred dog with a deformity is bred without that deformity to a purebred dog, the hybrid pups tend to have an intermediate look. For example, crossbred pups with just one Bulldog parent have more natural-looking will breathe much better than purebred pups with two Bulldog parents and faces. Healthwise, this is great news!

Crossbred dogs tend to truly have a average character.
Crossbreeding tends to generate a middle of the road temperament that often fits better into the average household compared to the more ""extreme"" characters of many purebred dogs.

But should you cross a breed that HAS a specific working behavior with a breed that doesn't have it, the chances are great that at least some of the puppies will not have it or will have it in a watered down form that is easier to live with.

Crossbred dogs are usually fitter.
All dogs have defective genes. All living creatures do, actually, including me as well as you! Unless you've TWO copies of it but many defective genes do not cause any problems.

Since his parents belong to precisely the same strain and share so a lot of exactly the same genes, including defective ones, a purebred pup has a higher risk of inheriting two copies.

But parents of different breeds (assuming those strains are not similar to each other) each tend to have distinct faulty genes. This minimizes the danger of a crossbred puppy getting two duplicates of the same gene that is awful. That's good.

Not only that, but this greater number of genes that a crossbred puppy inherits tends to result in physical and mental health and a stronger immune system. The genetic diversity of crossbred and mixed breed dogs is a healthy thing.

Among the benefits of having a purebred dog is you could study its character kind. A strain famous because of its low energy levels may be preferred by mature owners. Also, the ones that need a dog to get a particular goal, like swimming or hunting, should decide on a strain proven to shine in those regions.

Another big edge with purebred dogs is understanding just how much pelt it's going to have and just how large it's going to get. That is vital whether you've allergies and when contemplating your living space size. The main disadvantage isn't understanding how big it'll be as an adult when buying a mixed breed pup.","a1bc989d7fee35d06ce4e6ad3b599163ebd616c5eda632bc2deb5fcc0283f71"

The Phoenicians used blocks of pop to support their cooking containers and the mix of heat, sand and pop is reported as signs that they found this magic material. Following experiments to duplicate the Phoenician ""discovery"" have been unsuccessful. History shows that in the era about the time of the birth of Christ, given Man's imagination, and the combination of fire, civilization entered into an age where glass emerged as both a practical and cosmetic stuff. Who was the first to use this marvelous stuff? The answer is not as important as the diverse used that Man has devised to use it, for it definitely would be a distinct world without it!!

Whether by design, or perhaps by accident, Guy found that if he applied heat and and other substances combined sand, he could fuse, or melt, this combination of materials and when they cooled, they held their form as well as color. I prefer to link the first making of glass to the potter, who realized that by simply making a paste from sand and oil, then painting this glassy substance onto the surface of his beads, pots and vessels before firing, it enhanced their beauty and opened up a new process of decorating his products. Even now the potter uses a similar glaze beautify and to seal his pots. The primeval temples are abundant in glazed tiles, adding color and layout to walls and the floors, but creating a more durable surface that would resist wear from the sandaled feet of the worshipers. So successful was the utilization of these glazes that to this day, archaeologists are unearthing tiled floors that have the exact same sparkle as well as color as the day they were put down.

How excited the craftsman must have been - he was now able to create a container that would carry tinctures, the oils and potions of the day, and not like the clay pots he was proficient in making consume them.seed glass

Early glass vessels are extremely unlike glass as we all know it now. They were not clear, full of seeds of undissolved sand and full of bubbles trapped in the thawing process. However, Guy was on the course to developing what was to be a common part of our daily lives.

It seems no secret for the primary source of early glass has been into the graves of the rulers of the land from excavations that glass was the mark of the wealthy and noble. The Vatican Museum exhibits glass vials unearthed in the Catacombs. They are seedy, bubbly glass containers used by the early Christians to carry their oils and potions. Just by examining the contours of these relics, we're able to determine the glass workers of that time were using tools that even today are being used in the glass shops all around the world. Repeating this age old procedure presents a challenge to Mans genius even now, and also the advance of glass technology bears witness to this fact.

In the second century AD, the usage of glass spread through the Middle East. It was a trade item that is major, in the type of beads, jugs, bottles and amulets. It went with traders and the explorers of the time to the Far East, and, as its use spread, so, also did the centres of manufacture. The Greeks made early glassware that shows signs of being created on a pipe. They developed the decorations of their glass vessels to a fine art. Some unearthed Greek containers defy producing even today. In time the forms became more distinct and diverse and by the Fourth Century, drinking glasses and wine bottles were becoming common. So, also, was their price lowered, by refining the processes to make these things. Now, bottles, cups, goblets, vases and glass containers became more available. Rich and vibrant colors were created by adding silver, gold, cobalt, and, yes iron to the melt. These decorations enabled them to fashion and decorate into beads and stones to adorn the body.

Although there were many facilities for glass creation, a center in Venice, Italy soon was to dominate the craft of the time. Great sands and also the presence of woods to provide the fuel for the fires made Venice the perfect place to construct the glass houses of the time. About 1400 AD, there was such a concentration of glass houses in the city, in fact, that it absolutely was decided to move this concentration of infernos in the bay, outside to the isle of Murano, away from the growing city. They remain there now. The merchants of Venice, with their small ships plying the trade routes both East and West were quick to realize that the glass made in the glass houses of Murano has a ready marketplace. Here was a product of great value - it could be traded for GOLD! The retailers recognized that by doing so, they were trying to prevent competition and keep up their monopoly.

So, also, started the ferocious attempts to gain the ""secrets"" of the Italian glass houses, by coaxing, or even in some events kidnapping glass workers, the functioning technology distribute to the North. It went to Germany, France and areas in mid-Europe, where the sands and forests stood prepared to embrace this new technology. Alas, the very act of trying to keep a monopoly had created an atmosphere whereby it was unavoidable that it would be lost. The fires of Venice were producing glass on an enlarged scale and also the merchants became wealthier and their trade routes became bigger. Their successes were doomed.

The Venetians were not able to stop the motion of their techniques and the glass workers. Shortly the glass houses of Murano succumbed to the competition of the German, the French and others, who by now duplicated and enhanced the capacities of the Venetians. Soon, the quest for the secrets of the trade reversed and Venice found itself searching the workers who by now had advanced a step ahead of those out. For example, inmedalion the creation of glasses for the great Cathedrals of France, French glass workers had made a new array of colours within their glasses. Their ability to create them was overcome by the demand for windows produced from the French glasses. Here was an efficient method of producing glass in level sheets! Having solved this issue, the European glass houses began creating a ton of level glass.

The whole world was the glass workers oyster at the moment! Both women as well as men too, for that matter, had an insatiable desire for objects to adorn the body as well as home. The Italian flair put emphasis on function as well as ornamentation and we see examples of a simple wine glass being graced with animals, fowl, flowers and figures. They were masters of the usage of shape and color and also the world is indebted to the Venetians for their contributions to the artwork. The political arena in Italy in the 17th Century found the taxing on glass and corruption in government ruin the glass industry until it ceased, not to climb for 150 years and it dropped.

Glass came to the New World additionally and the Founding Fathers were quick to realize this new nation would be a giant marketplace for the products of the glass houses. Workers were not export, bringing along with them the tools of their craft and glass houses were began in Jamestown shortly after the very first settlers arrived in this bulls eye virgin land. Here was the extensive woods for fuel for the fires, the excellent littoral, so all the requirements were in place to develop a nearby business. Starting up, nevertheless, was not immediately successful. The generation became more costly as well as as the forests disappeared, the Jamestown glass houses shut down. The Dutch Company in New York attempted subsidizing the start of several glass houses. They too struggled to get started. New Jersey and Pennsylvania had extensive forests and outstanding sands, so in glass production the glass houses of New Jersey commanded for several years. To the north in Massachusetts, on the Island of Sandwich, there arose a group of glass houses and the glass created there still bears its name. The brand new authorities were offering incentives to the glass houses to the produce window glass for the new colonies and, before long, the glass houses were turning out level panes of glass made by spinning molten glass on the end of the pipe, and cutting it into small panes when cool.

Modern day molding systems have tried to duplicate the appearance of the ""bulls eyes"", but cannot duplicate the break-away point in the center of the spin, its sharp edges signaling the cracking off of the spun disk from the iron conduit. Each spun centre is person and the thickness of its own variation and the glass gives colour gradations which defines its identity. Designs cut to the outer layer were enhanced by the contrast between the two glasses.

With typical ""Yankee ingenuity"" and spurred on by the need for glassware of all kinds, the early American glassworkers devised a method to squeeze hot glass between molds, producing what we currently know as ""pressed ware"". When designs cut into the moulds, the design was replicated giving a cut effect. Slogans and mottos cut to the moulds also produced dishes glass cups and vases with popular topics of the colonial days. These, too, are sought after items by present day collectors. The glass shops released a veritable deluge of glass to this prepared market.

Picture, in case you will, the time it would take to hand craft all of the glass insulators essential to support even a single telegraph wire across this vast land. With insulators positioned on the wires every 50 feet, the number becomes astronomical. The machines to form them were developed which enabled the advance of the telegraph lines to carry on as rapidly as the crews place the posts. America was no longer dependent on this baby business grew by leaps and bounds and the European glass houses.insulators

Meanwhile, for glass, another fairly different market developed in Europe in the post Renaissance years. Astronomy, Medicine, and the sciences of Chemistry and Physics were leading Europe from the Dark Ages into an era of light and knowledge. Man had analyzed the skies at night through the eras and by this time had just partly comprehended the heavens. His natural curiosity drove him to delve into the mysteries of the Universe. He understood that the drop of water magnified whatever it rested upon and together with the arrival of glass into his culture, he shortly discovered that here was a substance, not unlike the drop of water, that allowed him to examine the content under it. It enabled him to see details he could barely see with his naked eye!

When he turned a tube towards the heavens with lenses in it, he saw details! No one content in history has had such an impact on Man's search for advice - it could unlock the mysteries of the Universe, and used properly, turned out to be a key!

Refinements in the first simple microscopes shortly led to higher and higher powers of magnification and also the capability to see the hidden world about him led to the important breakthroughs and spiked his curiosity in understanding the causes of diseases that had plagued humankind through the ages. He investigated derivatives and the extracts that had come down through the ages. As we are aware of it now, by understanding them, he began down the trail to Medication. Inside, he could boil, evaporate, condense and keep them. The laboratories of the chemists of the time called upon the glass workers to create the particular tools used by the scientist and also a standard of types of glassware was ordained, giving rise to the beakers, flasks, bottles and vials today, we use even. There developed a way of glass working called the ""German Method"", an off hand technique using glass tube as an alternative to the conventional forming of glass from the molten tank.

The demand for precise tube and rods to fill the requirements of the scientific community resulted in the creation of glass tube drawing machines whereby a consistent size of tube may be produced in big quantities. The state of the craft went from a gob of glass stretched between two glass workers as they walked apart from each other to an upward draw machine which drew hot glass from a bud, stretching it vertically to some height were the top end would be cool enough to break away into four foot lengths. Absolutely, as complex a scheme as the upward draw tower is, it just represents the adaptation of a hand procedure. In practice, the bulk of mass production of glassware is a modification of the old hand procedure. Making tubing and pole of consistent diameters for volume measuring devices and thermometers demanded close tolerances until glass tube and rod was being drawn to allowances of less than a millimeter and it was not long.

Guy rose to take the challenge of fulfilling the increasing need for glass. By accommodating historical hand techniques, methods were devised to change the need for more people, into the dependence on more machines. A giant step was taken by him in time as of this point. Larger furnaces were assembled, loaded with sand (silica), and traces of lead,mould lime, soda along with other trace minerals, and heated to the molten state. A drain was put in the vat rather than have the glassblower dip to the vat of molten glass, as well as a continuous stream of molten glass, much like taffy that was hot, was drawn from the melt. This ribbon of hot glass was chopped into sections, dropped into molds (nearly as hot as the glass), as well as a plunger pushed to the mold to move the hot glass around until it filled the mold. Anyone who has ever stacked dishes can comprehend the process. Pile one cup into another which carries some liquid, and see the liquid rise throughout the second cup. It is possible to see the glass molding procedure done right before your eyes. It was that simple. Until then the process was very labor intensive. But now glassware could be produced by the machines in some instances unattended, around the clock. The resultant never-ending stream of dishes, light bulbs, bowls, flat plates and all the many sorts and forms of glass products, gave new life to what was to become sector.

Now here was a substance that has been simply ""tailor made"" for the scientific community in the pursuance of the character of the worlds treasures. Glass in its many forms was priceless in searching out the ""what and why"" of the things that helped as well as harassed mankind.

To examine the essence of the universe, scientists needed vessels, tubes, retorts, bottles, lenses and prisms, all to analyze things which might be quantified, adapted, and compounded. Glass has many unique properties desired to the scientist: the power to resist attack from virtually all chemical compounds, transparent, sturdy, inert, easily worked in its molten state, capable to be produced to close tolerances (making reproducible results possible in consecutive experiments), and neither adds to, or takes away anything stored inside it. So, when original research is underway, you are able to assume that the final results have been entered into by glass. When Dr. Jonas Salk set his Polio cultures in a sterile Petri dish, he understood there would not be any contamination from the host vessel. Not so with so many other mediums.

The staff glassblower adds her or his abilities to the research efforts of the chemist or physicist, bringing ideas to life, a link in the chain of talents crucial for success. Each had his or her speciality, so when a team, the ""hands on"" gifts of the glassblower lend support when needed. So to speak, to pass information along to the members. This information is priceless for members, as well as the regional and local meetings keeps members in touch with events and new developments, notwithstanding its societal worth.

Looking at man's advancement over time, we do well to note that pushing back the frontiers of science has enriched and fostered hope in our everyday lives, and assures that the same ardor for progress will continue forever.

Graphic a time when the world was dark, guy dwelt by the day hours, and expected the next dawn. He detected fire, then a method to burn a stick and create a feeble light. He must have thought ""nothing can get better than this"", then somebody discovered that fat burned off and made more light. WOW!

Another Pilgrim discovered the bees made a wax that would burn, and candles were born. WOW! Sailors found out that the oil of a whale combusted even more intense, along with the whaling business was created! WOW! Detecting by skimming it off with their blankets, the Indians who got the oil slick on creeks in Pennsylvania, a man dug a well so there was no need to really go to distant seas for whale oil, to locate oil here at home. The birth of Standard Oil! (As well as the demise of whaling) WOW plus.

Think of the as advancement, from whale oil for lighting, to the invention of the electric light, to the discovery of oil.

Ultimately, it was a glass envelope enclosing the filament that Thomas Edison brought really ""light to the world"". Any amount of experimental filaments, each fabricated right into a hand blown bulb, from silk, to carbon, to hair, to finally a tungsten cable. Many, many lightbulbs fell by the wayside. Also, the first light bulb was evacuated using the ""Toepler Pump"", a moving column of mercury to rid the lightbulb of oxygen. This pump consists of glass tube, and is in use in a few research procedures even now. It is the historic coming together of glass and electricity. A commendable start.

So, where did his glass envelop are got by Edison for his experiments? A glassblower, obviously, a crucial facilitator to research. This demand also extends even to today. We could associate the mass production of the myriads of glass contours to the adaptation of an initial 134 years""hand"" made prototype. Look in a wine shop to see how the wine industry has standardized on the shape of bottles. Someone had to say, ""this works, lets make a million of them"".

The very invention of the first hand made light bulb activated the boom effect in a number of businesses, besides creating the first light bulb industry. Glass must be made from the petroleum and coal business creating energy to heat these materials to bring glass, as well as elements dug in the ground, starting the mining sector. It had to be made available to fulfill an apprehensive need to any or all humans, once made. Many businesses were born as a consequence of Edison's single experiment that was successful. Even now, the light bulb is evolving, to some gasoline filled, coiled tube in the burning tungsten filament, and light emitting LED's. What is next?

Compare the rise in technology in the glass industry with any comparable industry and you'll observe that it's grown by bounds and leaps through the centuries. To make steel, for example, the process developed in the mid 19th century and to this day, the procedure has improved but little, the end product is the same as the day the Bessemer process was devised. Glass production, exceeded demands, as well as however has expected new needs and has kept up with. Initially, the soda lime, ""soft"" glass led the marketplace for laboratory glassware, then in the late 20's, the ""tough"" glass, PYREX was designed to avoid the railway lanterns from lens breakage in rainstorms. There is practically no kitchen that does not have an array of heat evidence ovenware.

The electronics industry has always cultivated demands for brand new and several types of glass, and now we find more and better glasses in the hands of millions in cells, tablet computers, computers, even up to the face plates on those giant television sets. Quartz ""boules"" are grown in intense heat to be eventually sliced into thin draw plates resulting in substrates for the application of circuits that make computers potential. They defy the constraints of production, so when the technology developed, and got more and more minimized, bigger ""boules"", when sliced, now accept an increasing number of individual integrated circuits. Think of the problems solved between rolled hot ""soft"" glass out on a surface such as the first glass workers did to ensure it is flat to making a cylinder of silica and slicing it to get a flat plate.

Historically, the glasses now we know will be the product of fulfilling with a need to produce life more productive and simpler. From your early, seedy vessel to the computer chip, maybe, like no other stuff, we are served by glass in our day-to-day lives. Glassblowers through the ages have worked with, and had the imagination to revive and enhance this ""magic"" stuff. They also have assisted, by executing their craft, to empower other people to expand their frontiers, in a sense that defines man's imagination and challenge to surpass.","a1bc989d7fee35d06ce4e6ad3b599163ebd616c5eda632bc2deb5fcc0283f71"

Even though glass is only made from heated sand, it has provided humankind with many uses that scientists can then use to further our knowledge of the universe.  Take for example the work performed by glass in the telescope.
The telescope would not be possible without glass, by using the property of glass for magnifying objects, a telescope can view distances extremely far away.  One of mankind's biggest achievements is the Hubble Space Telescope which can view distances over 9 billion light years away.  And yet without glass, the Hubble Space Telescope would not be possible.   
At the other end of the spectrum, glass is also the key component in microscopes.  A microscope can magnify even the tiniest cell, and was the instrument which made possible the study of microbiology.  Without microscopes, we would not have learned that our bodies and all human living creatures are made of tiny single cells all working together to make a living specimen.
Glass has also played a major role in communication as fiber technology can transmit information across large spaces in a fraction of the time it would take without glass.  More and more telecommunication companies are making the switch to fiber technology due to the higher speeds allowed by the tech.
Yet another older, but just as important use of glass has been to help humans and their eyesight.  Glasses worn outside the eyes, as well as glass material worn as a contact lens, has helped many people to see 20/20.  Glass and the properties of light reflection and refraction have made scientific advances possible in a wide array of scientific subjects, ranging from deep space to the microscopic.","8f809eab27bddc8eeadb1622b16b4058c615f81d5dc237c49e33bad6f4d6f13"

When they negotiated the Maastricht Treaty in the early 1990s, Francois Mitterrand, Helmut Kohl and Jacques Delors considered the European Monetary Union would lead inevitably to a political union with more federal government.

But flaws uncovered by Greece's fiscal jam appear more likely to entrench a two-course system in which ""grown ups,"" headed by Germany, exert ever more control over wayward ""children"" like Greece.

It is possible, though less likely, from helping save a euro zone member in trouble, leaving Greece to turn to the International Monetary Fund for emergency funding that national variables could keep Berlin.

Also, it's conceivable that a state unable or reluctant to make the sacrifices prescribed Berlin by Brussels or Washington could default or seek to reschedule its debts.

That would not necessarily cause the defaulter's leaving on the euro zone, let alone prompt the fall of the single currency.

But it would set off a chain reaction of bank solvency problems needing crisis remedies for which the European Union is ill prepared.

In Brussels, predictably, the talk is of new powers of surveillance for the European Commission and its data office, the need for closer economic government and possibly the creation of a European lender of last resort.

But Germany, the biggest European market, has made it clear that it generally does not need E.U. examination of its own export-oriented policies, which create huge current account surpluses that economists say are partially responsible for widening imbalances in the euro zone.

Prime Minister Yves Leterme of Belgium needs a European debt bureau that would issue bonds that are common empowering all euro zone nations to borrow at the exact same price. That too is a nonstarter in German eyes and unacceptable to Finns and the Dutch.

Larger fiscal transfers within the European Union or the 16-nation euro zone look impossible because of post-crisis retrenchment.

Economists like Daniel Gros of the Center for European Policy Studies and Thomas Mayer of Deutsche Bank have proposed a European monetary fund to design and run I.M.F.-fashion help systems for euro-area countries in difficulty.

But it is hard to see how such ambitious notions could be implemented without treaty transforms unanimously approved by the 27 E.U. states.

That appears overly difficult to chew over after years of anguish in getting ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, which amended the first E.U. agreements.

A two-course euro zone really has been a reality since 2004, when E.U. funding-discipline rules were frozen, subsequently rewritten, to prevent sanctions against France and Germany after they repeatedly breached the deficit limitation.

Greece has been put under E.U. financial tutelage, but no such intrusion has been visited on France, for example, which has a deficit of more than twice the E.U. limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product.

This two-type euro zone will cause resentment and aggravate mistrust between little and large states, south and north. The Union was made to do things differently, although that's how power works in the real world.

The German constitutional court or national political resistance may yet make it impossible for Berlin to join a rescue.

A euro zone nation unable to raise affordable funds on the marketplaces would then face a choice of going to the I.M.F., defaulting, or seeking to reschedule its debt.

Euro zone leaders have made such a taboo of bringing in outside enforcers that to do so now would send a message that the family was incapable of coping with its own difficulties.

A default, even of a small economy like that of Greece, strike against the euro and could give rise to a chain of bank insolvencies. For this reason the German political and financial institution would likely have to back a bailout, despite public fury.

Such an occasion might shock the European Union into closer integration.

But it would more likely prompt sticklers for fiscal discipline, like Germany and also the Dutch, to withdraw farther into national-interest policies.

The most unlikely choice is the fact that a nation might walk away from the euro zone.

The price would be tremendous, and there's no serious discussion of alternative euro states under pressure or this in Greece -- only in nations and among people who forecast that it'd end in tears or opposed monetary union.","a1bc989d7fee35d06ce4e6ad3b599163ebd616c5eda632bc2deb5fcc0283f71"

Collagen vascular disease refers to a group of disorders which change your connective tissue. Collagen is a protein- based. The connective tissue holds muscles, ligaments, and bones collectively. Collagen vascular disease is sometimes also called connective tissue disorder.

Some ailments classified as collagen vascular diseases change your joints, skin, blood vessels, or other vital organs. Symptoms vary according to the specific ailment.

Cases of collagen vascular disease include:

lupus
rheumatoid arthritis
scleroderma
temporal arteritis

-Causes
Reasons for Collagen Vascular Disease
Collagen vascular disease is an autoimmune disease. What this means is your immune system mistakenly attacks your body's healthy tissue. The attacks are usually in the form of inflammation. In this case, your immune system causes inflammation in joints that are nearby and the collagen.

According to the National Institutes of Health, the origin of the attacks isn't understood (NIH, 2011).

Several collagen vascular disorders, including lupus, scleroderma, and rheumatoid arthritis, are more common in girls than men. This group of disorders generally affects adults in their 30s and 40s. Based on the Mayo Clinic, children as young as 15 can be diagnosed with lupus (Mayo Clinic, 2011).

-Symptoms
Symptoms of Collagen Vascular Disease
Each form of collagen vascular disorder has its own group of symptoms. Nevertheless, most forms of collagen vascular disease do share a number of the same general symptoms (NIH, 2011). Individuals with collagen vascular disorders commonly experience:

Tiredness
muscle weakness
Temperature
body pains
joint pain
skin rash
Symptoms of Lupus

Lupus is a collagen vascular disease that causes unique symptoms in each patient. Additional symptoms can include shortness of breath, chest pain, headaches, and dry eyes. People with lupus may have long periods of remission without symptoms. Symptoms can flare up during times of stress or after prolonged exposure to sunlight.

Some patients have long-term issues with dry eyes and also a dry mouth. Some people with this form of collagen vascular disorder have an inflammation of the blood vessels or of the heart's lining.

Symptoms of Scleroderma

Scleroderma is an autoimmune disease that can affect other organs or the skin, for example, heart, lungs, or digestive tract. Symptoms include thickening and hardening of the skin, rashes, or open sores. Your skin sense lumpy in places, or may feel as if it is being extended. Systemic scleroderma can cause wheezing, coughing, and breathing difficulties. Acid reflux diarrhea, joint pain, or numbness in the feet are also possible symptoms.

Temporal arteritis is another form of collagen vascular disease. Individuals with temporal arteritis have an inflammation of the large artery in the head. Symptoms can include jaw pain scalp susceptibility, headaches, and vision loss.

-Treatment
Treatment for Collagen Vascular Disease
Treatment for collagen vascular disorder changes according to your individual condition. Nevertheless, many connective tissue disorders are generally treated by immunosuppressant and corticosteroid drugs.

Corticosteroids

Corticosteroids reduce inflammation through the body. This category of drugs helps normalize your immune system. Corticosteroids can take important side effects including mood changes and weight gain, in some individuals. Many people may find a rise in blood sugar while taking corticosteroid medications.

Immunosuppressants

Immunosuppressant medication works by lowering your immune response. Your body will no longer attack itself much when your immune response is lower. Nevertheless, having a lowered resistance can improve your own risk of becoming sick occasionally. Protect yourself from straightforward viruses by staying away from family and friends with flu or colds.

Physical Therapy

Mild exercise or physical therapy may also treat collagen vascular disorder. Range of motion exercises help you keep your freedom and may reduce muscle and joint pain.

-Outlook
Long-Term Prognosis
The prognosis for collagen vascular disease really depends upon the specific ailment, and changes in each individual. Yet, they do have one thing in common: all autoimmune diseases are chronic conditions. They've no treatment, and they must be managed by you throughout your life. Luckily, there are successful treatments to help keep acute symptoms at bay.","a1bc989d7fee35d06ce4e6ad3b599163ebd616c5eda632bc2deb5fcc0283f71"

Plug a normal telephone into its phone jack, then plug the adapter directly. Some Internet phone providers also let you make calls through your computer; it is, like Skype, required by others. But the prodigy of the majority of Internet phones is that your computer is not required at all.

Raising competition from technology upstarts like Vonage and nervous traditionalists like Verizon has caused insanely low prices for VoIP (voice over Internet protocol) service. For flat rates as low as $20 per month, you will get a U.S. phone number with unlimited national calling--and several services also throw in Canada and parts of Latin America, Asia, and Europe, too. Moreover, because the small Internet phone adapters plug into any broadband Internet connection, you will be followed by your cherished 212 number to Abu Dhabi.

Competition has also led to a proliferation of newfangled Web characteristics, a lot of which have spread to most carriers. You can have your voice mails emailed to you or assess them online. You can forward your calls to several numbers--like cell or your work --simultaneously. And many have some sort of online address book that can enable call and call filtering, too.

The downside of VoIP is the fact that it's not actual phone service. You may pay fewer taxes, but you do not automatically get, say, 911 service, and the thing won't work in a blackout. Reliability additionally is not always up to landline snuff. Sometimes there's no dial tone, your outgoing calls don't go through, or the other party can't hear you. I also have a nagging suspicion that I'm missing important calls, a fear stoked by dotted criticisms like, ""Your Internet phone blows"" and, ""Why does your blasted phone never pick up?""

Still, VoIP marketing has become so ubiquitous that even my dad wants in. To discover if VoIP is really mature enough to replace your land line, I performed a series evaluations on seven services. Bear in mind that these results are very unscientific: The quality and dependability of these telephones depends in great measure on dependability and the caliber of your Internet connection. It will not mean my experience was typical, while my set up--a cable modem--is very common.

Methodology

Does it sound as great as a land line? I phoned a tester with no Internet phone experience (my dad) and asked him to blindly judge each phone. To hear how each system performed with small bandwidth, we'd conversations while I played Xbox online and downloaded and uploaded tremendous files on BitTorrent. To find out how well each telephone distinguished background noise and my voice, we spoke while I blasted the Architecture & Morality of OMD.

Dependability(15 points): Do outgoing calls always go through? Does each incoming call actually ring? The idea was to see how many of the nearly 60 calls were actually set or received. Each missed call led to a one-point deduction from the most score of 15.

Many others charge quite low per-minute rates. I averaged the per-minute rates from the United States to London, Paris, Shanghai, and Tokyo, then plotted the prices on a five-point scale. The most expensive service got the most economical 5 points, 1 point. (To be fair, the greatest average--AT&T's 6 cents per minute--was not really high.)

Portability (5 points): I lugged every one among these devices on a plane to Los Angeles, and not one of them set off any red flags with luggage screeners. Two of them went to Abu Dhabi with me, where they passed through customs without a problem. The score, then, is based only on weight and size.

Today most VoIP providers have the same suite of attributes, but some are losing huge ones (on-line voice mail), and others stand out with intuitive Internet interfaces that allow you to get call forwarding schedules or even program music to play while your friends are on hold.

Number selection (5 points): But half the fun is selecting your entire phone number, and occasionally your own area code. Points were given for ease of availability and choice of the coveted 212.

BroadVoice
BroadVoice was examined by me as the geek option. It advertises the power to BYOD (i.e., ""bring your own device""), meaning you're in luck if you're one of the few who has something like the ZyXEL P-2000W v.2 Wi Fi phone. For the rest of us, the most appealing thing about BroadVoice is the promise of unlimited calling to 35 nations. If only it worked. During the reliability evaluation, the telephone got stuck on a fast busy signal for more than two hours when making outgoing calls. It didn't do so good in voice quality. My dad grew frustrated with all the garbled sound as soon as I uploaded a few large files to check the result to limited bandwidth. ""This one is the pits,"" he said.

The free computer-to-computer phone service has formed a play to be your regular telephone. Skype now gives the bare minimum that fromregular phones, plus voice mail service and you'll need to replace a land line: incoming and outgoing calls to. The variety isn't very big, although you will have fun selecting your contact number through a snazzy interface that searches for specific sequences of digits or letters. (Also, for some reason your number shows up on different peoples' caller ID as a weirdo foreign amount.) In the automated evaluation, all but one incoming call came through. But when I called on my own, calls several times wouldn't connect and I Had have to try again. The hollow voice quality wasn't nearly up to landline snuff on my PC laptop that is older, either.

Verizon VoiceWing
Verizon's ""VoiceWing"" service raises a vital question: Dilute a brand that is recognizable by devising a dumb name for the VoIP service? (Also see: AT&T CallVantage.) Regardless, VoiceWing's top-notch Web site features integration using its online yellow pages and enables you to organize simultaneous ringing of work number, cell phone, and your VoIP line. But in the standard dialogue test, my dad thought VoiceWing seemed a little tinny. When I made company calls, one source explained I seemed ""blurry"" and said to call back. Can you hear me? Not good.

I've been a Packet8 customer for over a year now. In the last several months, everyone's lowered their prices while continuing to offer features that Packet8 does not have--like online voice-mail retrieval, which I desperately covet. Instead, Packet8 has invested its time making an optional $250 videophone that at least works pretty well (even between Abu Dhabi and New York). The great news: The voice quality was perfect when I wasn't uploading anything, and not awful otherwise. ""It's a lot better than the usual regular telephone,"" says father.

GalaxyVoice
In case you are willing to sacrifice some voice quality, the cheapest choice turns out to be an excellent value. GalaxyVoice offers 212 amounts, the smallest adapter I tested, as well as an ideal score in the reliability evaluation. But the real claim to fame here is the ""free"" strategy: Pay $60 for an adapter and activation fee and you get 60 minutes of outgoing calls and unlimited incoming calls at no cost, so long as you accept a Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, or New York area code--including 212! The catch: Even under ideal conditions, the quality wasn't so excellent, and it was entirely hopeless to have a conversation during the BitTorrent/Xbox evaluation.

$29.99 activation fee and $29.99 per month for unlimited calling in the U.S. and Canada (first month free, through Dec. 31, 2005).

Along GalaxyVoice, CallVantage is the only service which didn't miss a single incoming or outgoing call. Most significant, this was the sole supplier to seem as good as or better during Xbox and normal /BitTorrent dialogues than a land line. The reason, an AT&T flack tells me, is that their adapter replaces your router and restrains back bandwidth-hogging devices (like your computer or Xbox) while you are on a call. Regrettably, that means it is bigger than just about any other adapter--about the size of a little George Foreman grill. And in addition it has to be wired between your cable or DSL modem and whatever else that is on the Web, making it more cumbersome to unplug and take with you. Not that my dad cares. ""This is the one I need,"" he says.

Devastating scenes in Japan from the quake, tsunami and now the nuclear crisis function as a reminder how fortunate many of us are.

For me, this was followed by watching Comic Relief charity event in britain on March 18 and seeing the poverty in Uganda on the TV -- it was nothing short of shocking. As it dropped into orbit around Mercury, the nearest planet to the sun in exactly the same period, I was closely following NASA's MESSENGER space probe.

I found myself wondering if it is correct that we are spending all this money on space exploration when people on our own planet are suffering so dreadfully, either at the hands of poor governments or Mother Nature.

Mission to Mercury
Mercury itself has actually had rather plenty of press of late, as the last few weeks have been a fantastic chance to try and discover this miniature evasive planet. When inner planets (Mercury and Venus) orbit around the sun and reach the extremes of their orbit as seen from Earth, they are at their easiest to spot.

It's been excellent to see the nearest planet to the sun and amazing to know that we have sent a miniature space probe there to study it. But for me, even more breathtaking was seeing Discovery dock with the International Space Station a couple of weeks ago.

That question about backing still nags at me however.

Large Amounts
The MESSENGER mission cost $280 million (which, in reality, is not a vast amount for a space mission). The launch of a space shuttle costs $450 million and there have been about 130 of them. It cost $1.7 billion to build only one of the five-strong fleet.

Eventually, the International Space Station has, over the years of its existence, cost an estimated $142 billion and that is not including the plethora of smaller space missions, other space agencies and other expenses entailed in space exploration.

These are large numbers, as it is possible to see. Yet there is an urgent requirement for funding to save lives down here on Earth, also.

Although space exploration definitely isn't over-funded, should we keep throwing money into space exploration when there are so many examples of human suffering?

More Cash, Less Suffering?
But this is only one example; there have been countless great fund-raising efforts globally through the years. Public fundraising brings in money for these causes that are great, yet governments give billions in foreign aid too. The UK for instance, gives around $11 billion every year in foreign aid.

So, my mind wander back to last year's Comic Relief show when I was observing many of the exact same scenes I saw this year and another question pops into my head: ""why is not any of this getting better?"" It seems that cash isn't the answer, or maybe the cash isn't getting spent in the proper locations (is the issue too large to be solved with the money being raised?). Either way, I actually don't believe pouring more and more money into these difficulties will make them go away.

Do not get me wrong, if I thought for one second that ceasing space exploration would mean these issues would be solved, then I 'd be one of the first calling for missions to be junked.

Spinoffs
We already see tangible benefits for ultimately resolving issues down here on Earth developing space technology and enriching all our lives. Water purification techniques that were developed for space exploration are being used in third-world countries, finally preventing disease and saving lives.

There are greater yields of crops thanks to space-driven technology, not to mention advances in medicine from treatments for brain cancer to more accurate thermometers.

The environmental benefits are wide ranging, as satellites in orbit supply valuable data about how our atmosphere is evolving.

To be honest, a large number of space-motivated technologies - too many to list -- have altered the shape of society. Out of interest, NASA maintains a ""spinoff"" online database detailing how NASA's space attempts have real-world advantages.

Enriching Society
I'll let you draw your own decision on this particular emotive topic, but for me I 'll continue to love and support man's quest of the Universe knowing that cash alone can't simply get rid of world suffering.

I'll settle back and take pleasure in the pictures from MESSENGER, knowing that space endeavors not only progress humankind's understanding of the Universe, but in addition drive. I will still contribute cash to help fellow man, knowing... expecting, that one day those who make the final decision on the way that it's spent will send it in the right way.","a1bc989d7fee35d06ce4e6ad3b599163ebd616c5eda632bc2deb5fcc0283f71"

A diverse workforce can provide concrete advantages besides simply carrying through legal compliance and good faith efforts to a firm. Actually, as markets grow worldwide having the ability to understand and reach out to the individual needs of people from various other cultures and regions will be predominant. Companies are given that key edge by a multicultural, talented, and trained employee base.

Diversity is here to stay
Diversity recruiting is one of the latest issues in corporate America now. The latest census results firmly established that the ethnic make-up of the U.S. is transforming at a speed faster than anyone has expected. Corporate America is already alert to the changing demographics; in fact many corporate frontrunners established diversity initiatives back in the mid-90s. More than a decade after, the bottom-line results haven't been measured in dollars, but instead in supplier diversity, retention and the demographics of women and minority recruiting.

A diverse work force enhances:

Connection with the customer: The needs of varied customers should be comprehended

Employee motivation: When they are handled with dignity and respect, workers maintain productivity.

Employee invention: A work environment open to diversity remains flexible and favorable to worker invention.

Worker recruiting and retention: A workplace that accentuates concern and interest for its workers as people first is capable to bring a higher-quality work force.

Continuous quality improvement:
An environment where worker abilities are valued will help continuously enhance quality.
Diversity in the office is not unprofitable

The study found, the annualized return for the 100 companies which rated lowest in equivalent employment opportunities dilemmas, average 7.9 percent, compared to 18.3 percent for the 100 companies that rated highest in their equal employment opportunities. ""Consequently, the stock exchange performance of the companies which were high performers on the glass ceiling-associated goals was 2.5 times higher than that of the companies that invested little in glass ceiling-related dilemmas.""

Meanwhile, while big business can afford large-scale studies, what about small business?

Diversity is marketable
Diversity initiatives be the catalyst for a better ROI in human capital and can boost the standard of an organization's work force.

Customer bases are becoming more diverse than the work force.

The combined Black, Asian and Hispanic buying power is more than $750 billion.

Girls are the main investors in more than half of the U.S. homes.

Girls buy 70 to 80 percent of all products; African Americans spend nearly $500 billion annually on services and goods; and Hispanics are the fastest growing consumer groups in the United States. A name for fair treatment is one of the primary reasons women and minority consumers say they stay loyal to a company.

Exploiting the power of diversity

Based on we concur, and CKR Interactive:
When people consider recruiting advertisements, they usually think of on-line job postings, paper print advertisements, possibly even career fairs. We think of reaching out and communicating to your future employee where they live and breathe when we think of recruiting advertisements. That means we go beyond what's been done (and overdone). We constantly look at behavioral modeling staffing profiles and lifestyles of all kinds of candidates in all businesses.

Everything we do is designed to be different, better and much more successful in aiding you to recruit and keep top talent. We take a look at the big picture and then provide you with options that are new, innovative and exceptional.

We understand that recruiting a diverse workforce is not about running an advertisement with a picture of a diverse group of people in it or filling a quota. Authentic diversity begins with a mission through recruiting a number of excellent individuals with varied backgrounds, abilities, ideas and cultures, to obtain strength as an organization. It ends with your firm reaching out to a specifically targeted audience that'll assist your business realize that mission.

Now more than ever it is important that employers recognize that diversity has turned into a benchmark in how they are perceived.","a1bc989d7fee35d06ce4e6ad3b599163ebd616c5eda632bc2deb5fcc0283f71"

As your income increases, your capability to give to a Roth IRA diminishes. If you are married filing jointly, your ability to give begins phasing out at a modified gross adjusted income (MAGI) of $183,000 for your 2015 IRA. If you're single, the phaseout starts at $116,000.

Once your MAGI reaches $193,000 (married) or $131,000 (single), you can not give to a Roth IRA. Instead, you give to a conventional IRA, but deductibility depends on other factors (see below). You have to make contributions to a Traditional IRA, then convert it into a Roth if you would like a Roth IRA.

The main dilemma you have to resolve is how you'll have the capacity to use the tax advantages offered by your IRA, once you have determined your qualification:

Conventional IRA: Get a tax deduction now (reducing your present income for tax purposes), for the contributions you make. Your money grows tax-deferred, meaning you don't have pay taxes until you begin withdrawing money from your account after, when the money is taxed at your marginal rate.
Roth IRA: But, the money grows tax free, so you don't have to pay taxes on it when it's time to withdraw the cash.
The question that many ask themselves is whether they anticipate to pay more taxes now or later. If you decide on a Roth IRA, you pay taxes now, but should you retire in a higher tax bracket, or if taxes go up over time, you are shielded from those increases.

With a Traditional IRA, you save money now--providing you can deduct. You want to lower your tax liability right now, and if you're concerned about your present income, a Traditional IRA can work for you. A Traditional IRA is, in addition, ideal in case you think that your taxes will be lower after. You put off until you are likely to owe less, paying your taxes.

Understand, too, that your income can limits your ability to cancel your tax liability that is current with your Traditional IRA contributions. See the IRS site for tax write-off limits.

Bottom Line
Determine whether you believe that your tax situation will change upon retirement, and it's up to you to think about your position. In the event you can't contribute to a Roth IRA due to income restrictions, but you are concerned about the tax situation in the future, you can convert from a Traditional to a Roth (a ""backdoor"" Roth contribution), and pay taxes now. Generally, should you feel that your taxes will be higher in the future, a Roth is considered a great alternative.","a1bc989d7fee35d06ce4e6ad3b599163ebd616c5eda632bc2deb5fcc0283f71"

It's somewhat clear why pupils are marked in this way, but how should teachers be graded?

While the method of student assessment is an important argument, something that deserves a bit more focus is the evaluation of teachers. Based on The Pew Charitable Trusts, teachers are typically assessed through their pupil's test scores and haphazard observations. However, just as standardized test scores are an inaccurate representation of a pupil's knowledge, these evaluation strategies are often of how well a teacher performs in class incorrect.

According to an article from the New York Times, a number of the U.S.'s largest school districts have began implementing student surveys created by Panorama Education, a technology startup run by two young Yale graduates. Panorama Education asserts that their surveys are a reliable instrument to ""measure student perceptions of teaching and learning.""

Anyone is able to freely download a sample of the survey from the website of Panorama Education. It asks questions that cover an important range of groups. These classes include pedagogical (teacher) effectiveness, classroom environment, expectations/rigor, student involvement, supportive relationships, awareness of belonging, interest in theme and resolution. Each category has approximately 5 questions with response options which range from ""very bogus"" to ""quite accurate."" These surveys not evaluate teacher effectiveness, but the effectiveness of students too.

There are a lot of advantages to conducting surveys in this way. In the NY Times article, the survey encounter Leila Campbell, a humanities teacher at a charter school in California, had is mentioned by writer Farhad Manjoo. Through the survey results, she found that because she was a white teacher in a mainly urban area, her students did not feel comfortable asking questions and generally had a harder time connecting with her. Campbell used this feedback to improve her communication.

The same as any type of assessment though, there's still room for bias and inaccuracy. As Trey Ferguson, Leesville math teacher, pointed out in his email interview, these surveys may be problematic because ""you've extreme cases (pupils that love you, and hate you)."" On a more humorous note, he added, ""I can only see this kind of use becoming an 'Educational' Yik Yak.""

As a result of Ferguson's concerns and others like it, Panorama Education has attempted to create their surveys in ways that values teachers fairly. Take the multitude of classifications, for example. As he says in his post, if the survey only asked questions about subject-related things, the info might be biased because specific students may feel exceptionally negatively or positively towards the area. However, because the surveys cover so much territory, there is more info to accurately evaluate teachers. Still, some argue that this standardized process of feedback isn't necessarily in a school's best interest.

Robert Phillips, English teacher, believes that teacher evaluation should continue to be an in-school procedure involving administrators, as ""adding another level of corporate interference in the classroom is [not] the response to improving student outcomes.""

What could be beneficial, however, are more teacher made surveys and potentially comments from other teachers rather than administrators. Regardless of who is discovering, Ferguson, Phillips and Robert Thornhill, science teacher, all concur that teacher surveys, along with observation responses, are fulfilling annually, as far as improving themselves.

""I love surveys,"" said Thornhill in his interview via e-mail.

Overall, teachers themselves are more fit than anyone to determine what additional feedback will benefit them the most. Yes, the evaluation of pupil test scores and classroom observations might be required, but whether or not teachers decide to take it a step farther through surveys should be up to them. The survey methodology behind Panorama Education may work for some, but should continue to remain elective.","a1bc989d7fee35d06ce4e6ad3b599163ebd616c5eda632bc2deb5fcc0283f71"

From the research that I have done, the best path seems to be a combination of peer review and student evaluation. 
Peer review involves meeting eith the teacherd, discussing the approach to be used, and most importantly, face to face discussion after the fact. The greatest obstacle to this kind of review is the time and resources required to make it effective. A flexible schedule would need to be worked out, allowing for each teacher to be both a reviewer and reviewee.
The student evaluations present no appreciable cost in time or effort, except for the time required for the teachers to read the responses, and determine what their approach will be. There are sites that contain guidelines for survey questions, and how to handle the result. Again, discussing the results with colleagues adds greatly to the effectiveness of the review. 
The disadvantages to student review are that the students may not take the surveys seriously enough to provide quality feedback. Studies have shown that this is not a terribly important consideration. Those remarks that are obviously out of context can be easily recognized, and their effects minimized. 
To conclude, both teacher peer review and student evaluation should be integrated into a comprehensive systemd for the most profitable results.","f5e7863193d8797dd2ddeef5543f17f73f4d75eec29a3e2bbb5a4792ae0d385"
